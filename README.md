## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
### <span style="color:pink"> 1. Why did you decide to participate in the project?</span>
I’m excited about this opportunity. I’ve heard of your reputation in the IT industry, and I would be proud to participate in the project in a company with such an excellent track record and a strong example of leadership in this industry.

Nowadays, IT technologies are really important for everyone.  In turn for me shall also help to acquire experience and sharpen my skills. 



### <span style="color:pink"> 2. What was driving you?</span>
I saw a lot of succesful people, who don’t afraid to change their profession, who connected their life with IT technologies and i was inspired by them.

Sometimes it is necessity. Sometimes it is passion. Even curiosity, compulsion or coercion. But when you take a closer look, it becomes obvious that all this is driven by something more abstract, that is unique and special to the human state. And that is…Your Purpose.

Purpose is a motivating force, your invigorating energy. Purpose is what drives you to do what you already do – and want to keep doing.

Setting study goals will help me plan, focus and use my time for study effectively. No matter how high and unreachable your goals and targets seem today, sooner or later I will  reach them.

I want to be a specialist in QA. To achieve my goal  i must to develop, learn and acquire new skills,  to be able to advance.


### <span style="color:pink"> 4. What are your expectations for the project?</span>
I hope that because of your project I can get for myself a lot of new information, team-working, interesting and promising training. In the future I will be able to apply this knowledge for my future job.
